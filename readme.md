The manager of Blue House Surgery would like to enhance the existing customer support system with online services.
That should allow the customers to do the following:

- to register and get an user name and a password in order to access the online services;  
- to login  
- to check the GP or nurse’s availability on a specific day;  
- to check all the GPs and nurses on duty on a specific day;  
- to book, change and cancel an appointment;  
- to extend the prescriptions; the user should have access to the list of medications and be able to  extend just those that can be extended.  
- To check the results of tests they have done.  
- to chat online with a receptionist. 

The same system is used by the receptionists that should be able to:

- check the calendar of appointments (per day, week, month) ;
- book, change and cancel an appointment for a patient;
